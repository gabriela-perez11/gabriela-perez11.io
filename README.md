## Individual Interpretation, Limitations, Future Reccomendations + Reflection

The first output scenario of our model aimed to maximize public health and well-being within a 38.5 million Euro budget. We used this figure in order to see  within an average-range green space budget how many targets we could reach. Ultimately, this scenario would cost 34.9. million Euros to be achieved. The map in Figure 3 of the report shows how little can actually be achieved within this budget, showing small patches of new green space in the Niew-West and Noord regions of Amsterdam. The output shows that only 8 new patches of green space can be implemented within this budget, and correlates with the higher price-points and lack of available space in other regions of Amsterdam. In total, only 8 hectares of green space are able to be implemented within this small budget. 

One limitation of our study is scope. Because of our limited time and expertise, we were not able to include as many important variables that are necessary and important within real-world green space implementation. Like for example age - many studies show that elderly populations and children benefit the most from green spaces, so this could be an important facet of implementation. Further, there is a great variety of different types of green spaces that this study did not distinguish between like parks/playgrounds, walking trails, grassed areas, and tree-covered areas which provide different types of activities and benefit different kinds of people. Further, because of the larger size of our polygons, Prioritizr was unable to give recommendations for green spaces like narrow green corridors or greenbelts which could be very beneficial as green space because their skinnier geographical size would mean that people could live much closer to them.

For future research, I would recommend researchers to look into the limitations I suggested above in order to get a wider-encompassing solution.

Overall, my interpretation of this output scenario is that it is incredibly costly to implement new green spaces in dense and compact cities like Amsterdam. While the parks in Amsterdam are fairly large, they are quite spread out spatially, and perhaps people may be better served by public green spaces if they were smaller and closer together, further I think the idea of greenbelts/green corridors would be an excellent priority and could both be used as green spaces for enjoyment, as well as walking and bike paths for movement
